# Flatiron Engineering Best Practices

## Learning Goals

- Explain practices used by engineering teams like Flatiron's to collaboratively manage complex systems

## Introduction

Without working on an engineering team, it's hard to build expertise in the tools, practices, and techniques that engineering teams use to build and maintain complex systems. In order to get a sense for what those tools and practices are like, read the docs under the heading [Flatiron Engineering Best Practices](https://docs.learn.co/team-processes/best-practices/).

As you read, keep a list of questions - terms you don't know, solutions to problems you don't understand, or context you are missing for paragraphs. After you finish reading, go back through your list of questions and spend a few minutes googling each one. If google doesn't turn up results that are clarifying, ask another instructor or someone from the engineering team.

## Post-check

- Most of these docs were about communication, not about anything technical. Why do you think that is?
- Some of these docs were written as checklists. What makes checklists useful on an engineering team?
- Lots of the docs explicitly mention that they are guidelines, not fixed rules. Consider how teams build good judgement as a team strength. How can processes contribute to good judgement? How can they deter good judgement?

Find 20 minutes to talk through these docs with someone on the tech team - if you can, someone on the ops side. Ask them questions about the tools and processes they use to manage complexity as a team. What is missing from these docs? What is over-emphasized? How have they strengthened their teamwork and complexity-management skills?
